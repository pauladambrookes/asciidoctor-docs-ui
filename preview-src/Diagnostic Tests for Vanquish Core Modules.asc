Chromeleon supports diagnostics for Vanquish Core modules.

The diagnostics feature provides several diagnostic tests for Vanquish Core modules, allowing you to check the operability of certain components of a module. This is useful, for example, during failure analysis, or as a preventive measure, such as, for preventing leakage after a column was exchanged or during regular maintenance works.

Diagnostic tests can be triggered manually, as described below. To setup your diagnostic tests on a recurring basis, refer to Scheduling Health Check.

== To Run a Diagnostic Test
. Using the Chromeleon Console, select your Instruments tab and select your configured Vanquish instrument from the list.
. Click the  button for Troubleshooting and Diagnostics on the Instrument tool bar above the ePanel Set.
. From the drop-down list, select the Diagnostic Tests option.
+
A window with the diagnostic tests related to the current instrument configuration is displayed over the ePanel Set. The window of the diagnostic tests provides additional information, such as, the names of the diagnostics tests available depending on the instrument configuration, the name of the user who last ran each test, the last result available for each test, the last date each test was run, and the date of the next scheduled test, if applicable.

. To run a diagnostic test, click the  button in front of a diagnostic test. The test results will display immediately after the test has finished.
