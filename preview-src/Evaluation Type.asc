= Evaluation Type

Select an evaluation type for each component. The evaluation type is used for calculating the calibration curves and amounts.

Unit::
Not applicable

Value Range::
Area/Height/CE Area/Relative Area/Relative Height

Default::
Area

Related Parameters::
* Calibration
* Group

Description::
Specifies the peak property to be used for the calculation of quantitative results.

Parameters::

Area:::
Peak area evaluation. All amount calculations refer to the peak area which itself is calculated numerically according to the trapezoidal method. Area delimiters in this case, consist of chromatogram, baseline and, if necessary, perpendiculars in order to exclude adjacent unresolved peaks. In case of riders, an appropriate skimming tangent substitutes the baseline.

Height:::
Peak height evaluation. All amounts refer to the peak height; that is, to the height of the peak maximum as related to the baseline.

CE Area:::
CE-Area = Area / Ret. Time in [mAU])

Relative Area:::
+
--
Relative peak area evaluation. The area can be chosen relative to the area of either:

* All components
* Identified components only

Select the Exclude ISTD components check box to exclude internal standards.
--

Relative Height:::
+
--
Relative peak height evaluation. The area can be chosen relative to the area of either

* All components
* Identified components only

Select the Exclude ISTD components check box to exclude internal standards.

[NOTE]
--
.Note
* Evaluation and calibration always require the same type.
* All peaks of a Group must use the same evaluation type.
* Only the area evaluation types can be substantiated by physics.
