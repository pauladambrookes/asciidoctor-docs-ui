= Licensing Principles

This topic describes the basic principles for understanding license handling in Chromeleon 7.

Managing licenses is required only in enterprise installations with multiple computers on a network. If Chromeleon runs on a single workstation that is not connected to a network, no further license managing is required.

== Requirements

In order to manage licenses in the License Manager, you must have:

* Received the license initialization code.
* Installed Chromeleon software on all computers.
* Added license initialization codes to Chromeleon.

In addition, the Manage Licenses privilege is required.

[NOTE]
.Note
License codes must be activated within a certain time period. (This is one of the setup tasks when you first install Chromeleon software; for details, refer to the _Installation Guide_.)

== License Service and Network Failure Protection

Each Chromeleon computer is connected to a central License Service that handles all the licenses within a network. The License Service runs on the computer where the License Initialization code is present, usually the same computer that serves as a central Discovery Service (Chromeleon Domain Controller). Other Chromeleon computers can automatically locate their License Service, a manual selection is not required.

Chromeleon provides a network failure protection that allows users to continue work on all Chromeleon computers even if the network is down and the central License Service is unavailable. To achieve this, information about the last granted license will be stored locally on each computer. This license will be available to users during a network failure, even after an application restart.

[NOTE]
.Note
In order to use Chromeleon you must have a valid license matching the software version you have installed. For details, refer to the Installation Guide.

== Client and Instrument Controller Licenses

Chromeleon offers a set of license features. Depending on the purchased license, some license features are included, while others are not. There are license features required for instrument controllers on the one hand, and license features required for Chromeleon users on the other.

=== License Types

Instrument Controller License::
* It is required by the Instrument Controller to connect to instruments of different Instrument Classes, or record 3D data. Therefore, the number of required instrument controller licenses depends on the number of Instrument Controllers, and your type of instruments.
* Instrument controller licenses are always permanently associated with the instrument controllers (see also fixed license below).

Client License::
* It is required by users to use the Chromeleon Console, control instruments from there, process data in the Chromatography Studio, use GLP functions (such as versioning of data objects), or use Virtual Column. Therefore, the number of required client licenses depends on the number of users that need to perform these tasks simultaneously.
* Client license features may be assigned to workstations, for example, to ensure that an instrument can always be accessed from an instrument controller workstation during a network failure.
* Client licenses can be assigned permanently to specific users or workstations, or can be used as floating licenses (see below).
