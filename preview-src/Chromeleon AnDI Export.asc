= Chromeleon AnDI Export Template File

A Chromeleon AnDI Export Template file (.caxt) is a data definition file that defines Chromeleon data in an XML format suitable for export to an AnDI file (Analytical Data Interchange file, .cdf).

When you export Chromeleon data to the AnDI file format, you can select a .caxt file in the Data definition file list in the AnDI Export Parameters dialog box. By default, the installed file, AnDIExport.caxt, is selected in the list. Alternatively, you can select a custom .caxt file from the list (if available).

[NOTE]
.Note
The default installed file, AnDIExport.caxt, is located in the Exports folder of the Chromeleon Installation folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Thermo\Chromeleon\bin\Exports`. +
If you want a custom .caxt file to appear in the Data definition file list, you must create it and add it to the Exports folder in the Chromeleon Product Data folder (e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Dionex\Chromeleon\Exports`).
 
== Default Data Fields
The default set of data fields, defined in AnDIExport.caxt, which are always exported to the AnDI file format, include the following (corresponding to the category 2 AnDI standard):

* Sequence name
* Injection list (including injection names)
* Raw data
* Peak list (including peak names and numbers)
* Peak type
* Peak area (full width)
* Peak height
* Peak retention time
* Peak start and end
* Baselines (including modified baselines from manually integrated chromatograms)

This default set of fields is defined in AnDIExport.caxt in XML format as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<GAMLData>

  <SequenceData>

    <Sequence Formula="seq.name" Label="Name" Alias="SequenceID"/>

    <Sequence Formula="Seq.creation_operator" Label="Operator" Alias="Operator"/>

  </SequenceData>

  <InjectionData>

    <Injection Formula="injection.type" Label="Type" Alias="SampleType"/>

    <Injection Formula="injection.comment" Label="Comment" Alias="SampleIdComments"/>

    <Injection Formula="injection.inject_volume" Label="Volume" Alias="InjectionVolume"/>

    <Injection Formula="injection.amount" Label="IntStd" Alias="Amount"/>

  </InjectionData>

  <ChromatogramData>

    <Option Name="IncludeRawData" Value="true"/>

  </ChromatogramData>

  <PeakData>

    <Peak Formula="peak.amount" Label="Peak Amount" Alias="PeakAmount"/>

    <Peak Formula="peak.width(0)" Label="Peak Width" Alias="PeakWidth"/>

    <Peak Formula="peak.start_detection_code" Label="Start Detection Code" Alias="PeakStartDetectionCode"/>

    <Peak Formula="peak.stop_detection_code" Label="End Detection Code" Alias="PeakStopDetectionCode"/>

    <Peak Formula="peak.asymmetry(&quot;ep&quot;)" Label="Asymmetry" Alias="PeakAsymmetry"/>

    <Peak Formula="peak.manipulated" Label="Manipulated" Alias="ManuallyReintegratedPeaks"/>

    <Option Name="IncludeBaselines" Value ="true"/>

  </PeakData>

</GAMLData>
----

== File Structure

The .caxt file contains four sections for sequence, injection, chromatogram and peak data fields. Within each section, the data fields are defined by the following formula:

 Formula="<Chromeleon formula>" Label="<label>" Alias="<GAML alias>"

.Where

* `<Chromeleon formula>` is the formula used to identify data in Chromeleon (e.g. injection.comment) as used for report variables (see Report Variable Categories).

[NOTE]
.Note
--
* Arguments can be included in the formula, e.g. `"peak.width(10)"`.

* Any formula containing quotes should use the following syntax for specifying the quotation marks: (`"<value>"`). For example, `"peak.asymmetry(&quot;ep&quot;)"`.
--

* `<label>` is the label parameter displayed in Chromeleon. It is exported as the parameter `"label"` attribute. If this is not specified, the `<Chromeleon formula>` is used as the `"label"` attribute.

* `<GAML Alias>` is an identifier that is used to map GAML data fields to AnDI data fields.

[NOTE]
.Note
When Chromeleon data is exported to the AnDI file format, Chromeleon first converts the channel data to an intermediate GAML (Generalized Analytical Markup Language) file, which is then converted to an AnDI file.
 

For example, to export the sample injection volume, the following formula is specified in the `<InjectionData>` section of the .caxt file:


 <Injection Formula="injection.inject_volume" Label="Volume" Alias="InjectionVolume"/>

 

Raw data and baseline data are also included in the .caxt file using the `Option` data fields in the chromatogram and peak sections respectively. These contain a `Name` attribute, `"IncludeRawData"` or `"IncludeBaselines"`, with their `Value` attribute set to `"true"`:
 
[source,xml]
----
<ChromatogramData>

  ...

  <Option Name="IncludeRawData" Value="true"/>

</ChromatogramData>

<PeakData>

  ...
    
  <Option Name="IncludeBaselines" Value ="true"/>

</PeakData>
----

[NOTE]
.Note
The Option fields must be positioned after any Formula attributes in the .caxt file.

== Create a Custom File

All data fields required by the AnDI standard (as defined in the default installed file, AnDIExport.caxt) should be present in any custom .caxt file. You can add additional data fields to create a custom .caxt file as follows:

. Copy AnDIExport.caxt (located in the Exports folder of the Chromeleon Installation folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Thermo\Chromeleon\bin\Exports`) to the Exports folder in the Chromeleon Product Data folder (e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Dionex\Chromeleon\Exports`).
+
[NOTE]
.Note
--
If there is no Exports folder in the Chromeleon Product Data folder, you must create one.
--
. Rename the copied AnDIExport.caxt file.
. Open the renamed .caxt file in an XML (or text) editor.
. Add your custom data fields to the .caxt file, following the formula guidelines provided above.
. Save the new custom .caxt file.
. The new custom .caxt file will be available for selection in the Data definition file list in the *AnDI Export Parameters* dialog box.
