= DAYS360

DAYS360 returns the number of days between two dates based on a 360-day year (twelve 30-day months). Use this function to help compute payments if your accounting system is based on twelve 30-day months.

`start_date` and `end_date` can be text strings using numbers to represent the month, day, and year (for example, "1/30/93" or "1-30-93"), or they can be serial numbers representing the dates.

If `start_date` occurs after end_date, `DAYS360` returns a negative number.

If `method` is `false` and start_date is the 31st of a month, it becomes equal to the 30th of the same month. If `end_date` is the 31st of a month and `start_date` is less than the 30th of a month, the ending date becomes equal to the 1st of the next month, otherwise the ending date becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.

If `method` is `true`, any `start_date` or `end_date` that occurs on the 31st of a month becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.

.Syntax
`DAYS360 (start_date, end_date, [ method ] )`

== Parameters

`start_date`, `end_date`::
The two dates between which you want to know the number of days.
 
`method`::
A logical value that specifies whether the European or US method should be used in the calculation. If `false` (or omitted), the US (NASD) method is used. If `true`, the European method is used. The default is based on the local translation. It should be correct for your location.

NOTE: To determine the number of days between two dates in a normal year, you can use normal subtraction--for example, "12/31/93"-"1/1/93" equals 364.

.Example
`DAYS360("1/30/93","2/1/93")` returns 1
