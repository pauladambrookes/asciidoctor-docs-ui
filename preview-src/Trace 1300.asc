= TRACE 1300 Series GC II: Tips for Instrument Control

This topic provides miscellaneous information about controlling the TRACE 1300/1310/1300E GC.

== Leak Check
You can detect gas leaks from an inlet using the Leak Check functionality in Chromeleon. When you perform a leak check, the GC measures the column flow with a true mass flow sensor and compares it to a calculated flow value obtained from the original column constant to see if the numbers match. The instrument detects a gas leak if there is a significant difference between the two values.

[NOTE]
.Note
With a TRACE 1310 GC, you can also perform a leak check using the front panel of the GC. Refer to the TRACE 1310 Hardware Manual for details.

=== To Start the Leak Check

The following procedure is described for the TRACE 1300 Series GC II driver. If you use the TRACE 1300 Series GC driver which is located under "Obsolete" in the manufacturers list of the Instrument Configuration Manager, refer to TRACE 1300 Leak Check.

[NOTE]
.Note
This procedure requires the use of the column-flowmeter connector. Refer to the TRACE 1300/1310/1300E Hardware Manual for details.

. Before starting a leak check, make sure there is a gas flow through the inlet. For example, in the Commands window (see Control Instruments Using the Command Window) set the FlowMode to PressureCtrl, set the PressureCtrl to On, and specify a nominal pressure value: Pressure.Nominal.
. On the ePanel of the TRACE 1300, select the inlet tab of the inlet to be tested (FrontInlet or BackInlet).
. Click the *Leak Check* button.
. In the *Leak Check* dialog box, make the following settings to set up the leak check:

* *Pressure Setpoint*—set the pressure for the leak check.
* *Allowed pressure drop*—set a value by which the pressure is allowed to drop and still be considered to pass. Note that the available range depends on the Pressure Setpoint setting.
* *Duration*—set the duration for the leak check test.

[NOTE]
.Note
The pressure and column flow values are displayed in the audit trail.
+
. Click *Start Check*. The status including elapsed time and remaining time can be viewed in the Leak Check dialog box.
* The system is automatically pressurized with carrier gas and sealed to perform a leak check.
* At the end of the leak check, if the system is free of leaks, the Leak Check Passed message is displayed.
* If any leaks are found, an error message is displayed. In this case, eliminate the leaks and repeat the leak check procedure.

[NOTE]
.Note
--
Only a previous Column Characterization, performed under leak-free conditions, can ensure the validity of the subsequent Leak Check responses.

To exit the leak check menu without performing a leak check, click the Close button. To abort the leak check, click the *Stop Check* button.

== Restrictions

The following restrictions only apply to the TRACE 1300 Series GC ("Obsolete").

=== Modifying Instrument Methods

Instrument Methods must be created or modified using the Instrument Method Wizard/Editor. It is not possible to manually create or modify an instrument method using the Script Editor View.

=== ePanels

The following ePanel restrictions apply.

* TCD detector: for this detector, the Set makeup flow control is not available on the ePanel.
* Aux Temperature ePanel not available.

Instead of using the ePanel controls to control the module, you may use the Command window to change a property or execute a command. For details on how to use the Command window, refer to Controlling Instruments: Control Instruments Using the Command Window.
